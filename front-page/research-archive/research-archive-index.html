                The Yurok Tribe is the largest tribe in California with over 6,000 members. It is located at the very end of the Klamath water basin taking up a two mile strip along the last 41 miles of the river system. The name Yurok translates to “downriver” given their position fathers down the river.

              <a class="description"> The power dynamics within the klamath watershed skew the sovereignty towards the settlers. The Tribe is subjected the the environmental hazards perpetuated by people farther up the water shed. This is not a new conflict. Many years of illegal setteler activity has led to the distruction of the land and culture.

                  <a class="description"> Early fur traders came to the area in search of beavers to hunt and trade. They over hunted the beaver population to near extinction. This led to a rapid decrease in dams and water flow was changed forever. The areas farther up the watershed flooded and created lush prairie lands that would later attract more settlers to the area for the goldrush. The decrease in dams had a great effect on the water flows and thus the local salmon population’s spawning habits for generations.

                  <a class="description">The giant redwoods and sequoias along the pacific northern coast attracted loggers. After years of logging operations going unobstructed, the Klamath only has 5% of its old growth forests still intact. Even today lumbering operations continue right outside the borders of the Yurok Reservation. These operations pollute the river by removing the roots keeping the soil on the mountains from running into the river. The redwoods are also vital to the local wildlife. They provide shade for cooling the water and ensuring salmon can get up and down stream. They are also historically used by the yurok for building and ceremony.

                Farmers have settled on reservation land to avoid authorities. They pollute the water and threaten elders with gun violence. Through this we can see that these same colonial patterns are destined to repeat themselves over and over unless dealt with on a fundamental level.

                 Salmon are vital to the Yurok people but also the landscape and life within the Northern Pacific Coast. Salmon and other anadromous species spend their adolescent life within the rivers before heading out to the ocean. When they return to spawn they bring with them a vibrant amount of ocean derived nitrogen. They spawn up rivers and depending on the species, they either die or return to the ocean. They provide the people, animals, and riparian forests with necessary nutrients to thrive.
                 <p></p>
                 As settlers moved to the area, they constructed dams to support their agriculture and power. These dams cut the salmon off from their historic spawning grounds. The dams also slowed water flow causing the rivers to heat leading to mass salmon die offs. Furthermore, irrigation and agriculture operations food the river system with pollution. All of this has led to a 99% decrease in salmon species and populations in the Klamath.

                  The history of the United Indian Health Services began in 1968. It was a time when Native activism coincided with the nation-wide Civil Rights Movement and the Office of Economic Opportunity programs. Together these factors helped create a new era of self-determination for Indian peoples.

                  In California, where health services were so lacking, Indian groups formed their own health organizations. Each maintained its separate programs but together they started the California Rural Indian Health Board Inc. (CRIHB), an organization which continues providing its members with a variety of quality improvement and advocacy services. Sheer determination, hard work and financial sacrifice paid off when UIHS became an official non-profit organization, ready to serve people in 1970.

                  UIHS started with community outreach services. The first services provided on site were dental services. UIHS continued to expand it’s services into nearly every large town within Humboldt County, as well as servicing tribal members from every Rancheria and Reservation in the areas of Humboldt and Del Norte Counties. The use of UIHS mobile services allowed the clinic to provide services to tribal members who still lived in areas that had no electricity or telephones.

                  Over the next twenty years UIHS outgrew four sites, started several satellite clinics, and went from offering basic visiting community health representative’s, dental and medical services to a thoroughly modern, full spectrum health service agency. Along the way UIHS has increasingly realized it’s goal of incorporating traditional values and customs into daily activities.</a>

                      <a class="description">Redwood or Cedar Plank Houses were built by many North Coast tribes up to and through most of the 19th century. Typically the houses were approximately 20 feet by 20 feet not including the roof overhang. The planks were either split from naturally fallen trees or removed from large trees, allowing the tree to heal and remain alive. The center section of the roof had moveable planks to allow for adaptation to varying climatic conditions. It also served as an outlet for the smoke generated from the fire below in the center of the pit. The pit was dug into the earth approximately 4 feet and it is where the family lived - cooking, sleeping and the rest of a family's indoor activities took place here. In Yurok culture, the men did not sleep in these family houses. They, instead, spent their nights in sweat houses. We plan on building a limited number of sweat houses in various scales soon.</a>

                        A typical Yurok Village is either located by Klamath River or the shore of the Pacific ocean. The Yurok used the hills behind the shore for hunting, getting redwood trees, firewood or picking berries. Most of the year they lived in a rectangular redwood house, but when they were traveling they had temporary homes made of brush. The way the houses received their address or name was based on the people that have lived there, where the house is located, and the history of the house. That is how the villages were formed.</a>
